This is a classical Angular-CLI based project illustrating my proposed form control validation directive.

It contains 3 versions of the same component. All display a `.form-group` containing a required input.

The first one, component1, doesn't add any CSS class to the form group.

The second one, component2, uses `[class.has-danger]="nameControl.dirty && nameControl.invalid"` to add the `has-danger`
class to the form group when the input is invalid.

The third one, component3, uses my proposed form control validation directive to achieve the same thing.

The application can be built, in AOT mode, using 

    ng build --aot

And you can inspect the generated code for the 3 components in `dist/main.bundle.js`.

I have extracted the code generated for the 3 components in the directory `generated-code`.

The rest of this README is auto-generated by the CLI.

# ValidationDemo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
